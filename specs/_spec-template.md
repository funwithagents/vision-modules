# Concept name

**Status:** Draft

## Purpose

What this concept is and why it exists — the problem it solves for the rest of the system. Keep it to the essential idea; design detail goes in the sections below.

## Core concepts / Decided

The settled design. Prefer concrete, testable statements over prose — data shapes, the public API surface, invariants, the decisions that later code and reviewers can hold you to. Link to related specs with `[other-spec.md](other-spec.md)`.

## Open questions

Genuinely-unresolved decisions, each with enough context to pick it up cold. A spec can be `Stable` (or `Implemented`) with open questions **only** if they are deferrals (nice-to-haves, future extensions), not load-bearing unknowns the current design depends on. Write `None currently.` when there are none.
